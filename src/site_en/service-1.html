            entities of the Russian Federation to accommodate foreign
            citizens, as well as other criteria established by law.

          <br /><br />
          <h4>How to Apply for Temporary Residence Permit</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            A foreign citizen has the option to submit documents in person,
            via the Multifunctional Public Services Center, or through the
            State Services portal. However, despite the requirement for
            pre-registration, there is a risk of encountering long queues due
            to limited time allocated for document acceptance. Consequently,
            it's possible that documents may not be submitted on the scheduled
            day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After submitting the documents, if everything is filled out
            correctly and a complete package of documents is submitted, the
            foreign citizen will be issued a certificate. According to the
            regulations, the period for reviewing the documents is 4 months.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h4>How to check the status of the TRP</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            If a TRP for a foreign citizen is approved, he will receive an
            electronic or paper notification by mail. Also, to check the
            status of the TRP, there is a simple and convenient service from
            the Ministry of Internal Affairs. To send a request, enter the
            region in which the foreign citizen submitted the application,
            date of birth and passport number.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If 4 months have passed since the date of submitting the
            documents, and the check of the TRP has not yielded any results,
            contact the Main Migration Department of the Ministry of Internal
            Affairs or the migration center where the documents were submitted
            in person to find out about the decision.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h4>What to do after Receiving a Temporary Residence Permit</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            If the TRP is approved, the foreign citizen must be notified by
            mail (in paper or electronic form). The notification will also
            indicate when and where to come and receive the TRP stamp in your
            passport.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After receiving the TRP, the foreign citizen will need to submit
            fingerprints. This can be done at the same Main Department of
            Migration Affairs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs where the
            documents were submitted. First, fill out an application for
            fingerprinting, after which fingerprints can be submitted on the
            same day. The procedure is free. Then a note about the TRP will be
            placed in the international passport or a separate document with
            permission will be issued.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After this, the foreign citizen will have 7 days to obtain
            registration at the place of residence. This can be your own
            property or rented housing, with friends or relatives. If this
            deadline is not met, a fine will be charged and expulsion from the
            country is a possibility.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Registration is carried out by the Main Department of Migration
            Affairs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs at the place of
            residence. Required documents are an application, passport, TRP,
            document confirming ownership of real estate, or a lease
            agreement. A state fee will need to be paid.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If everything is done correctly, registration can be received on
            the day the documents are submitted.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One year after receiving your TRP, it will be possible to apply
            for a residence permit.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h4>Confirmation of temporary residence permit</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Each year from the date of receiving the permit, foreign citizens
            will have 2 months to confirm their income and their residence in
            the Russian Federation. Otherwise, the TRP may be canceled, or a
            fine or deportation may be imposed. In confirmation of residence
            in the Russian Federation, the addresses where the foreign citizen
            is registered, where he works and the period of work, where and
            when he left Russia, if any, are indicated.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The notification must be submitted through Russian Post offices,
            independently to the responsible department of migration or
            electronically.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>To submit a notification you need:</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              a completed residence notification form and to provide a foreign
              passport with a TRP;
            </li>
            <li>proof of income;</li>
            <li>
              a detachable part of the previous form of notification of
              residence (if the notification is not submitted for the first
              time);
            </li>
            <li>
              birth certificate (if the notification is submitted on behalf of
              the child).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            After the documents are checked, if everything is in order, the
            foreign citizen will receive a torn-off part of the notification
            of residence form. It is IMPORTANT to keep it safe as it will be
            required for next year's procedures.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h4>Validity period of the Temporary Residence Permit</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            The TRP is valid for three years. Extensions are not provided, a
            new one must be applied for. After the current permit expires, the
            submission of an application with a complete package of documents
            for a new permit is needed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Or, while the TRP is valid, a residence permit or citizenship can
            be obtained. If the TRP is about to expire, and the foreign
            citizen has not managed to obtain a residence permit or
            citizenship, they will have to leave the Russian Federation before
            the expiration date of the TRP.
